This page from 1889 includes, at the bottom, the numeral three used as a signature mark. Note that the page number, 49, is at the top. From Wikipedia:

> "A signature mark, in traditional bookbinding, is a letter, number or combination of either or both, which is printed at the bottom of the first page, or leaf, of a section. ... The aim is to ensure that the binder can order the pages and sections in the correct order."

According to the article, symbols such as ※, ✠, ❧, ☙, and ℺ were once used as bookbinding signature marks (although letters and numerals were more common). All of these are, today, Unicode characters.
