This print, from a wood engraving by F. Cresson Schell (Frank Cresson), shows oyster boats shooting at one another on the Chesapeake Bay off the Maryland shore in 1886. From Wikipedia:

> "New England fishermen encroached on the Bay after their local oyster beds had been exhausted, which prompted violent clashes with local fishermen from Maryland and Virginia. Watermen from different counties likewise clashed. ... The opposition press also mocked the governor for failing to capture the Dancing Molly, a sloop run by three women who managed to outrun the governor's ships. The Norfolk Academy of Music lampooned the governor's expedition in an April 1883 comic opera, _Driven from the Seas: or, The Pirate Dredger's Doom_."
