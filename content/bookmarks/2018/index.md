# I. People in Wikipedia

These sections, one per person, are ordered alphabetically by Wikipedia entry name (i.e. "John Doe" not "Doe, John"). Note that this reverses the typical alphabetization rule for most names in European languages.

As is the case elsewhere in this site:

* Quotations from Wikipedia entries lack footnotes when appearing within a section about that same Wikipedia entry.
* Footnotes within Wikipedia quotations have been removed.
* 30 underscores are used for thematic breaks, always between blank lines.
* The caret can be removed from both footnote parts to disable markdown rendering.
* 2 or more trailing spaces stops Markdown renderers from joining adjacent lines. In such cases I use 3 for clarity in search.

Tags used:

* gafsbe - A placeholder catchall for The Gilded Age, fin de siècle, and Belle Époque
* midcentury - Roughly 1930-1970
* posthumous-move - This person's remains were relocated [also used in gemlog]
* social-science - The social sciences, broadly defined

### Giotto

> "The year of his birth is calculated from the fact that Antonio Pucci[1], the town crier of Florence, wrote a poem in Giotto's honour in which it is stated that he was 70 at the time of his death. However, the word "seventy" fits into the rhyme of the poem better than any longer and more complex age so it is possible that Pucci used artistic license. 
> ... 
> While the Italian researchers were convinced that the body belonged to Giotto and it was reburied with honour near the grave of Filippo Brunelleschi, others have been highly sceptical." -- from

### Harriet Bedell

> "... moved to Goodland when the former city disbanded in 1957. She worked with whites, African Americans and indigenous people in Southwest Florida for the next three decades. The native Mikasuki gave Bedell the name Inkoshopie (meaning woman who prays) ... She also helped them sell their work to the tourist trade -- both through an arrangement with the Collier Company and by negotiating with northern department stores, as well as by fighting the sale of mislabeled import goods in local tourist outlets.
>
> ... In 1947, Bedell gave the invocation at President Harry S. Truman's dedication of Everglades National Park. ... The Episcopal Diocese of Southwest Florida began celebrating her life on the anniversary of her death, and the 8 January feast was extended to the Episcopal Church (USA) in 2009." -- from

### John Baskerville

> "His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a fellow printer ... An atheist, he nonetheless printed _The Book of Common Prayer_ in 1762 and a splendid folio Bible in 1763. ... His most notable typeface, Baskerville, is held to represent the peak of transitional type face and a bridge between Old Style and Modern type design. ... A Portland stone sculpture of the Baskerville typeface, _Industry and Genius_, in his honour stands in front of Baskerville House in Centenary Square, Birmingham. It was created by local artist David Patten in 1990." -- from

> "Baskerville increased the contrast between thick and thin strokes, making the serifs sharper and more tapered, and shifted the axis of rounded letters to a more vertical position.[8] The curved strokes are more circular in shape, and the characters became more regular. These changes created a greater consistency in size and form, influenced by the calligraphy Baskerville had learned and taught as a young man." -- from

Benjamin Franklin, while living at No. 36 Craven Street[1a] in London in 1760, wrote to Baskerville, reporting that his font was receiving unfounded criticism in London:

> "Dear Sir,
>
> Let me give you a pleasant instance of the prejudice some have entertained against your work. Soon after I returned, discoursing with a gentleman concerning the artists of Birmingham, he said you would be a means of blinding all the readers in the nation; for the strokes of your letters, being too thin and narrow, hurt the eye, and he could never read a line of them without pain. I thought, said I, you were going to complain of the gloss on the paper, some object to. No, no, says he, I have heard that mentioned; but it is not that -- it is in the form and cut of the letters themselves: they have not that natural and easy proportion between the height and thickness of the stroke which makes the common printing so much the more comfortable to the eye. -- You see this gentleman was a connoisseur. In vain I endeavoured to support your character against the charge: he knew what he felt, and could see the reason of it, and several other gentlemen among his friends had made the same observation, [and so forth].
>
> Yesterday he called to visit me, when, mischievously bent to try his judgment, I stept into my closet, tore off the top of Mr. Caslon's[1b] specimen, and produced it to him as yours brought with me from Birmingham, saying, I had been examining it since he spoke to me, and could not for my life perceive the disproportion he mentioned, desiring him to point it out to me. He readily undertook it, and went over the several founts, showing me every where what he thought instances of that disproportion; and declared, that he could not then read the specimen without feeling very strongly the pain he had mentioned to me. I spared him that time the confusion of being told, that these were the types he had been reading all his life with so much ease to his eyes; the types his adored Newton is printed with, on which he has pored not a little; nay, the very types his own book is printed with, for he is himself an author, and yet never discovered this painful disproportion in them, till he thought they were yours." -- from

Baskerville's mortal remains had an eventful afterlife.

> "Baskerville died in January 1775 at his home, Easy Hill. He requested that his body be placed 'in a Conical Building in my own premises Hearetofore used as a mill which I have lately Raised Higher and painted and in a vault which I have prepared for It. This Doubtless to many may appear a Whim perhaps It is so -- But it is a whim for many years Resolve'd upon, as I have a Hearty Contempt for all Superstition ...' However, in 1821 a canal was built through the land and his body was placed on show by the landowner until Baskerville's family and friends arranged to have it moved to the crypt of Christ Church, Birmingham. Christ Church was demolished in 1897[3] so his remains were then moved, with other bodies from the crypt, to consecrated catacombs at Warstone Lane Cemetery. In 1963 a petition was presented to Birmingham City Council requesting that he be reburied in unconsecrated ground, according to his wishes." -- from

Baskerville's house was eventually replaced by a large, art deco, civic building (1938) named after him:

> "Baskerville House, previously called the Civic Centre, is a former civic building in Centenary Square, Birmingham, England. ... The site was originally occupied by the home of John Baskerville. ... World War II halted construction of Baskerville House (hence the rear brick wall, intended to be temporary) ..." -- from

______________________________

Arthur Conan Doyle may have subtly acknowledged Baskerville (whether the man or the typeface) as partly inspiring the title of his novel, _The Hound of the Baskervilles_, by having Sherlock Holmes voice this remark (the italicized are newspapers, each presumably with its own typeface):

> "The detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I confused the _Leeds Mercury_ with the _Western Morning News_. But a _Times_ leader is entirely distinctive ..."[4]

### Joseph Schumpeter

> "Schumpeter claimed that he had set himself three goals in life: to be the greatest economist in the world, to be the best horseman in all of Austria, and the greatest lover in all of Vienna. He said he had reached two of his goals, but he never said which two, although he is reported to have said that there were too many fine horsemen in Austria for him to succeed in all his aspirations." -- from

### Paul Verlaine

> "Verlaine's last years saw his descent into drug addiction, alcoholism, and poverty. He lived in slums and public hospitals, and spent his days drinking absinthe in Paris cafés. However, the people's love for his art resurrected support and brought in an income for Verlaine: his early poetry was rediscovered, his lifestyle and strange behaviour in front of crowds attracted admiration, and in 1894 he was elected France's 'Prince of Poets' by his peers. ... he was buried in the Cimetière des Batignolles (he was first buried in the 20th division, but his grave was moved to the 11th division -- on the roundabout, a much better location -- when the Boulevard Périphérique was built)." -- from

### Terry-Thomas

Appeared in 97 films (1933-1980), 149 radio shows (1938-1970), 110 TV shows not including advertisements (1947-1983), and received 42 stage credits in the theatre (1946-1971). Terry-Thomas also has a medical condition named after him (one which he himself never had).[1]

> "By the time he reached adolescence, his parents' marriage had failed and both became alcoholics. In an attempt to bring them together, he often entertained them by performing impromptu slapstick routines, reciting jokes and singing and dancing around the family home. The performances seldom worked, and his father became increasingly distant from his family.
>
> ... he accepted a temporary position at Smithfield Market, where he earned 15 shillings a week as a junior transport clerk for the Union Cold Storage Company. ... He invented various characters ... and frequently recited comic stories involving them to his colleagues. His characterisations soon came to the notice of the company's management who prompted him to enrol in the company's amateur drama club. ... In 1933, he left Smithfield Market to work briefly with a friend at an electrical shop before he became [a] travelling salesman of electrical equipment. He enjoyed the job and relished being able to dress up in elaborate clothing in order to make his pitch. In his spare time, he began playing the ukulele with a local jazz band called the Rhythm Maniacs.
>
> ... Terry-Thomas finished the war as a sergeant, and was finally demobbed on 1 April 1946.
>
> ... By 1983, with his medical bills [incurred while resident in Spain, and so not under the NHS] at £40,000 a year and no longer able to work, Terry-Thomas's financial resources were dwindling. ... By 1984 Terry-Thomas was increasingly depressed by his condition and when he was interviewed that year, he admitted that "one doctor said I've got about four more years to live. God forbid! I shall probably blow my brains out first". In 1987 the couple could no longer afford to live in Spain, so moved back to London. They lived in a series of rented properties before ending up in a three-room, unfurnished charity flat, where they lived with financial assistance from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. Richard Briers was one of his first visitors at the flat, and was shocked by the change he saw: "Sitting there, motionless, he was just a mere shadow. A crippled, crushed, shadow. It was really bloody awful." On 9 April 1989 the actor Jack Douglas and Richard Hope-Hawkins organised a benefit concert for Terry-Thomas, after discovering he was living in virtual obscurity, poverty and ill health. The gala, held at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ran for five hours, and featured 120 artists with Phil Collins topping the bill and Michael Caine as the gala chairman. The show raised over £75,000 for Terry-Thomas and Parkinson's UK. The funds from the charity concert allowed Terry-Thomas to move out of his charity flat and into Busbridge Hall nursing home in Godalming, Surrey. He died there on 8 January 1990, at the age of 78.
>
> ... Following Terry-Thomas's death, Lionel Jeffries called him "the last of the great gentlemen of the cinema", ... Reviewing his career in The Guardian, Adrian Turner considered that "we took him for granted and he was ideal for his time. Not to put too serious a point on it, his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with British audiences during the fifties as they experienced the clumsy dismemberment of the Empire and the 'never had it so good' ethos of the Macmillan era. During the sixties he became a glorious anachronism, much in demand in America, who saw in him the irrelevant pageantry of Britain"; he also said Terry-Thomas was "a national treasure". Gilbert Adair, writing in The Independent, considered that "for three decades, and in literally scores of films, he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder"; ..." -- from

Sculpted a monument to John Baskerville, _Industry and Genius_ (1990), which stands in Birmingham.[1]

> "On the columns of Portland Stone are reversed bronze letters spelling Virgil, the Roman poet whose works were printed by Baskerville in the famous typeface that bears his name, in 1757. A poem in praise of the printer appeared in the Aris's Gazette in 1751, entitled 'Industry and Genius' from which the sculpture takes its name. The artist is David Patten, born in Birmingham in 1954 ..."[2]

> "A sculpture of the Baskerville typeface, _Industry and Genius_, in honour of John Baskerville stands outside the main entrance to Baskerville House in Centenary Square. It is by local artist David Patten and was created as part of the 'Percentage For Art' scheme in 1990. ... Made out of Portland stone and bronze, it is 150 centimetres (59 in) high, 100 centimetres (39 in) wide and 650 centimetres (256 in) long."[3]
