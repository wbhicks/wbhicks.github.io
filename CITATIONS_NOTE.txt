I'm using TiddlyWiki5 in this GitHub Pages project.

TiddlyWiki5 was invented by Jeremy Ruston. It's open source and is available from http://five.tiddlywiki.com/ or https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5 .

TiddlyWiki5, in turn, uses the following open source projects:

* [[The Stanford Javascript Crypto Library|http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/]]
* [[The Jasmine JavaScript Test Framework|http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/]]
* [[Normalize.css by Nicolas Gallagher|http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/]]

The source code shown in this GitHub Pages project has contained, and may still contain, code blocks and comments that I copied from other open-source programming projects. I copied these code blocks and comments consistent with the open-source licenses under which they were offered. To the best of my knowledge, the open-source license that I have applied to this project is consistent with those licensing terms.

In order to give proper credit to the authors of those code blocks and comments, I included the following information when it was available to me (that is, when it was publicly available): their names and how to reach them. I also included publication dates, where known. I included this information in-line, i.e. alongside the contribution.
